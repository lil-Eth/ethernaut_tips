# Level 9 : King

**Ethernaut Level 9 : King :** 

Fallback function : receive() (present here) and send()

Each time your contract sends Ethers to another contract,Â **you are depending on the other contractâ€™s code to handle the transaction and determine the transactionâ€™s success**.

â€”> Your valid transactions can arbitrarily fail.

As the transaction sender, you are always susceptible to the following cases:

- **Loophole 1: The receiving contract doesnâ€™t have a payable fallback function, cannot receive Ethers, and will throw an error upon a payable request.**
- **Loophole 2: The receiving contract has a malicious payable fallback function that throws an exception and fails valid transactions.**
- **Loophole 3: The receiving contract has a malicious payable function that consumes a large amount of gas, which fails your transaction or over-consumes your gas limit.**

â€”> Notice inside this fallback function, there is aÂ `king.transfer()`, which can fail if the current king is a malicious contract and refuses to withdraw.

â€”> Let's make a contractÂ `ForeverKing`Â that has NOÂ `receive`Â orÂ `fallback`

â€”> The current prize of Ethernaut Contract can be obtained like this : `await contract.prize().then(v => v.toString())` â‡’ 1000000000000000 Wei (1 Eth)

â€”> Make sure to implement a function payable allowing us to send some ether while deploying the contract. This function will trigger the `receive()` function of King Contract. The `msg.value` is set to prize which are dynamically fetching from the contract.

â€”> Donâ€™t forget (easy one) to not implement `receive()` or `fallback()` function so that no one can send Ether on it. There are plenty of ways to do it like implement one of these functions and added a `revert` statement on it but why more efforts ? be lazy ! 

â€”>Claim ownership requesting king and  Sending 1 eth to contract and then submit instance , with no fallback you will stay king ðŸ‘‘.

# **Key Security Takeaways**

- Never assume transactions to external contracts will be successful
- Make sure to handle failed transactions on the client side in the event you do depend on transaction success to execute other core logic
